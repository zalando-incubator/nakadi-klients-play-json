## Nakadi Klients Play Json Support

Provides [play-json](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaJson) support 
for the various [nakadi-klients](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/nakadi-klients) models.

### Build

```sbt
sbt compile
```

### Install

Add the following to your `build.sbt` when using SBT.

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "org.zalando.nakadi.client" %% "nakadi-klients-play-json" % "0.1.0"
```

### Usage

Implicit play-json formats are can be imported by doing
```scala
import org.zalando.nakadi.client.scala.PlayJsonImplicits._
```

Note that the play-json formats are recursive, so you also need to provide
a `Format`/`Read`/`Writes` for the base `Event` type you are dealing with.

This library also provides a generic serialization method which can be
passed as a parameter to the nakadi `client.publishEvents(..)` call, i.e.

```scala
import org.zalando.nakadi.client.scala.model._
import org.zalando.nakadi.client.scala.{Client, ClientError}
import org.zalando.nakadi.client.utils.ClientBuilder
import org.zalando.nakadi.client.scala.NakadiSerializer

case class MyEvent(message: String)

val events = Seq(MyEvent("Dino was born, he says rawr"))

val dataChangeEvents = events.map { event =>
  DataChangeEvent(event, "my_model", DataOperation.CREATE, None)
}

val client: Client = ClientBuilder()
  .withHost("some_host")
  .withSecuredConnection(true)
  .withVerifiedSslCertificate(false)
  .withTokenProvider(Option(() => "some_token"))
  .build()

client.publishEvents("my_event_name",dataChangeEvents,NakadiSerializer.seqDataChangeEventSerializer[MyEvent])
```

Note that in this example, you have to provide an implicit `Writes` for `MyEvent`


Please make sure that you format the code using `scalafmt`. You can do this by running `scalafmt` in sbt before committing.
